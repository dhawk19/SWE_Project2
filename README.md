# SWE_Project2
In this project 2 we are asked to develop the product vision, and then the initial prototype. Rapid prototype is the first thing to do in Agile software engineering methods, or product software engineering. So far our idea, is toc reate a app/website to teach kids and teens between the ages of 8-16 how to program.
